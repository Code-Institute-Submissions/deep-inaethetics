            Who We Are

        <p class="brief-description-2">
            Father of two, Alistair Graham, has been a pharmacist in Market Deeping for 11 years and is a familiar face within the local community. After working for two decades within the pharmacy industry he has now decided to switch careers and has set up a beauty
            firm offering the latest in aesthetic enhancements.
            <br>
            <br>Financial pressure within the pharmaceutical industry meant that less quality time has been made available to spend with individual patients and one on one interaction has become limited and he has decided to make a change in the direction
            of his career. As a trusted and well-known member of the local community, Alistair was keen to stay in Market Deeping and keep in touch with his valued customers. With reality shows like Love Island and being surrounded by the world of social
            media there is now certainly a trend across all walks of life and age groups that makes people think that they need some aesthetic help.
            <br>
            <br>Alistair decided to train at Harley Street as an aesthetic practioner to carry out a number of these procedures. These include now – seen-as everyday treatments such as lip enhancements, anti-wrinkle treatments and dermal fillers – that
            is, injections that fill out wrinkles, creases and frown lines and also lines around the mouth which deepen with age. A full free consultation will be carried out by Alistair before any treatment is booked and within this, medical history
            is looked at and all options are discussed in complete confidence. There is also a cooling-off period where the client can go away and think about the options discussed and this will allow the customer to make a measured and informed decision.
            This sets his practice apart from “BOTOX parties” where rash decisions are made en masse.
